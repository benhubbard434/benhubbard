    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>I'm Ben. By day I do customer success at Taxi for Email, working with the #emailgeek community. By night, I run, I eat, and I make stuff.</p>

   <h2>Tell me about your running!</h2>
   <p>I don't think anyone who's actually spoken to me about running has ever asked that question ðŸ˜….</p>
    <p>I run a lot. When I first moved to London, I was lucky enough to join <a href="https://www.rundemcrew.com/">Run Dem Crew</a>. I made so many amazing friends, and the wider RDC community makes up the majority of my social life in London. Around the same time, I joined <a href="https://trackeast.co.uk/">Track East</a>. It's like RDC's second cousin. We are founded on very similar values, and it's a great community to thrive in.</p>
    <p>A challenge I set myself was to complete 100 races before I turned 30. I managed it!</p>
