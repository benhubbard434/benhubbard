    <p>In my role at <a href="https://taxiforemail.com/">Taxi for Email</a> I look after the Customer Success, Support and Education team. My goal is to create the best customer experience for our users, and I want to use this blog to share my learnings and discoveries in public.</p>
    <p>The aim is to build a network of Customer Success professionals to learn from, and discuss ideas and approaches with on Twitter and via my semi regular newsletter.</p>
    <p>The majority of my career has been spent working for marketing technology platforms, in both marketing and customer success roles. Previous roles have been at GatherContent, and PAYMILL.</p>
