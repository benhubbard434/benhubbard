    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>I'm Ben. By day I do customer success at Taxi for Email, working with the #emailgeek community. By night, I run, I eat, and I make stuff.</p>

   <h2>Tell me about your running!</h2>
      <p>I don't think anyone who's actually spoken to me about running has ever asked that question ðŸ˜….</p>
      <p>I run a lot. Since moving to London, I've run with <a href="https://www.rundemcrew.com/">Run Dem Crew</a>,<a href="http://ldnbrunchclub.co.uk/">LDN Brunch Club</a>, and now with<a href="https://trackeast.co.uk/">Track East</a>, where I'm on of the captains.</p>
      <p>My social life revoles around running, and I've met some really awesome people through the various communities I've run with. More writing to come about those people.</p>
      <p>I set myself a challenge to complete 100 races before I turned 30. I managed it!</p>
