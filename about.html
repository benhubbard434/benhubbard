    <p>I'm Ben. By day I do customer success at Taxi for Email, working with the #emailgeek community. By night, I run, I eat, and I make stuff.</p>

   <h2>Tell me about your running!</h2>
      <p>I don't think anyone who's actually spoken to me about running has ever asked that question ðŸ˜….</p>
      <p>I run a lot. Since moving to London, I've run with <a href="https://www.rundemcrew.com/">Run Dem Crew</a>, <a href="http://ldnbrunchclub.co.uk/">LDN Brunch Club</a>, and now with <a href="https://trackeast.co.uk/">Track East</a>, where I'm on of the captains.</p>
      <p>My social life revoles around running, and I've met some really awesome people through the various communities I've run with. More writing to come about those people.</p>
      <p>I set myself a challenge to complete 100 races before I turned 30. I managed it!</p>

    <h2>Werk werk werk werk werk</h2>
    <p>In my role at <a href="https://taxiforemail.com/">Taxi for Email</a> I look after the Customer Success, Support and Education team. My goal is to create the best customer experience for our users, and I want to use this blog to share my learnings and discoveries in public.</p>
    <p>The aim is to build a network of Customer Success professionals to learn from, and discuss ideas and approaches with on Twitter and via my semi regular newsletter.</p>
    <p>The majority of my career has been spent working for marketing technology platforms, in both marketing and customer success roles. Previous roles have been at GatherContent, and PAYMILL.</p>
