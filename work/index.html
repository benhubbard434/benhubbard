    <h2>Offcuts by Office Shoes</h2>
     <p>Office wanted an online hub to distribute exclusive last pairs of shoes. We worked within their branding guidelines to build a online store on Shopify to sell this stock.</p>

	<h2>Merge London</h2>
	<p>I was asked to create a minimalist website for Merge London to fit with the brand ethos of minimalism. The site was created on a white, grey and black interface to allow the strong photography to stand out.</p>

	<h2>Volklore</h2>
	<p>Volklore approached me back in 2012 to build them a store on Big Cartel. They quickly outgrew their store, and we decided to move their store across to Shopify. The added functionality of Shopify attracted Volklore, and they've continued to grow since!</p>
