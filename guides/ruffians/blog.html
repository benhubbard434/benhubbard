  <h3 class="quater-padding">After the import</h3>
  <p>As we imported all the content from WordPress, the importer stripped all the formatting from the content. This means that if we were publish them in their current state, they'd appear in Times New Roman (the browser default font), with no space between paragraphs, as well as around images. It also didn't select a featured image.</p>
  <p>Currently, every blog post, bar three, are hidden. This means that they can only be accessed via the Shopify admin. Here's some steps to get these formatted and re-pubslished:</p>
