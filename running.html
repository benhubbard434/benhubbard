	<p>I love running! It's been a huge part of my social life since I moved to London in 2013, as well as my main source of fitness and mental resilience. There's nothing better than starting the day with a rin on a nice spring morning, honest!</p>
	<p>I run a lot. Since moving to London, I've run with <a href="https://www.rundemcrew.com/">Run Dem Crew</a>, <a href="http://ldnbrunchclub.co.uk/">LDN Brunch Club</a>, and now with <a href="https://trackeast.co.uk/">Track East</a>, where I'm one of the captains.</p>
      <p>My social life revoles around running, and I've met some really awesome people through the various communities I've run with. More writing to come about those people.</p>
      <p>I set myself a challenge to complete 100 races before I turned 30. I managed it!</p>
