<h2>Colophon</h2>
<h3>The technical bits</h3>
<p>Hosted by <a href="http://github.com">Github Pages</a>, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator to build the site. If you haven't tried it out before, I recommend getting stuck in, it's super easy.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>Both the heading font, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a>, and the body font, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya">Alegreya</a> are served by Google Web fonts, a free and easy way to serve fonts to a site.</p>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>I'm digging out the referral information, I accidentally deleted it from some commented out code - woops. They're all sourced from the Noun Project!</p>
