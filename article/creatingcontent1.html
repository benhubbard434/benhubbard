<h1>Creating Content: Standing out from the “noise” (Part 1)</h1>

<p>There’s an absolute ton of articles, blog posts and web pages out there already. So how do you make yours stand out?</p>

<p>Honestly, there is no guaranteed way of creating a successful article. There are many factors which determine whether your content becomes viral.</p>

<p>Defining success of an article in itself. Dave Chaffey <a href="writes">http://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/race-a-practical-framework-to-improve-your-digital-marketing/</a> about a digital marketing strategy being broken into four stages. This framework lays out the “journey” of a potential customer, from the moment you first get the attention of a fan right through to moving them to a brand advocate.</p>

<p>The various KPI’s at each stage show that there are different measurements of a successful article. As you’re trying to increase your audience, you want to create content that gains a lot of unique views, spreading your name around. Activity such as well targeted PPC adverts, alongside appropriate social media marketing are some of the easiest methods at this stage.</p>

<p>There are some fantastic uses of social media marketing out there. Brands such as <a href="Just Hype">http://store.justhype.co.uk/</a> and <a href="Black Milk">http://blackmilkclothing.com/</a> are some fantastic examples of Instagram being used and integrated with the website experience. These two brands have encouraged customers to become brand advocates, as they are creating the content. This is acting as a form of recommendation as customers show off their purchases on the site, and at the same time giving customers their 5 minutes of fame.</p>

<p>Allowing customers to create their own content also turns your customer into a brand advocate. Having this content closely integrated with your site moves your content onto the second stage of Dave Chaffey’s cycle. This is also one of the hardest parts of content creation; it’s objective is to persuade your potential customer to “engage” with the content.</p>

<p>To paraphrase this, your main objective at this stage is to encourage your site visitor to stay longer on your site, which is measurable by a reduced bounce rate.</p>
