title: Curating a playlist
category: music
---
<p>I’ve decided to start curating a weekly round up of some tracks that I’ve been listening to. I also decided to share this.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I’m not actually sure. A few people have commented in the past that I have a weird, but fun taste in music. So I’m opening it up to the world!</p>
<p>Here's this week’s playlist:</p>
<div style="width: 300px; margin: 10px auto 30px auto;">
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1V4K1ZZ4SKAJdLvrh7O7lS" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
</div>
<p>You can <a target="blank" href="spotify:playlist:1V4K1ZZ4SKAJdLvrh7O7lS">subscribe to the playlist</a> - I'll be updating this weekly with my new ten track</p>
