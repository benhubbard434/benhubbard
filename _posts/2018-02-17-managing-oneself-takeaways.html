<p>My biggest takeaways from this book for me was the need to identify my own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing these will help me identify what I need to work on to improve my career, and figure out where I'm headed:</p>
<p>"While analyzing, one will be able to understand their strengths, incompetence and the hindrances that may affect the strengths."</p>
<p>I can then couple this with identifying how I best learn and work. I shouldn't try to change myself as I am unlikely to succeed. Also, I mustn't try to take on work which doesn't suit my learning style, otherwise I will perform poorly.</p>
<p>An example of this in practice is to ask for instructions in the format which I best learn in. I must also think about this when producing work for others; what do my colleagues learn best in, and how can I deliver work in this format to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility for these relationships with others is key to being successful. The first part of this is to consider others are human beings and therefore they have their own individual strengths, values and style of performance. Whether it's your boss or colleagues, accept and understand their strengths, their values and how do they perform. The second part is to ensure that you communicate effectively with your colleagues, itâ€™s important to communicate to others about your values, strengths and how you perform. Equally important is asking others about the same.</p>
