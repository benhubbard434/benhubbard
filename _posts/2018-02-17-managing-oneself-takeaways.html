<p>The biggest takeaways from this book for me was the need to identify my own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing these will help me identify what I need to work on to improve my career, and figure out where I'm headed:</p>
<p>"While analyzing, one will be able to understand their strengths, incompetence and the hindrances that may affect the strengths."</p>
<p>I can then couple this with identifying how I best learn and work. I shouldn't try to change myself as I am unlikely to succeed. Also, I mustn't try to take on work which doesn't suit my learning style, otherwise I will perform poorly.</p>
<p>An example of this in practice is to ask for instructions in the format which I best learn in. I must also think about this when producing work for others; what do my colleagues learn best in, and how can I deliver work in this format to help them succeed.</p>
