<p>I have a love hate relationship with Twitter. On one hand, I can credit the social network with my career path so far, having found every single one of my jobs through “my network” (what a great phrase).</p>

<p>On the other, it’s full of gammons who think opinion is fact, and a bunch of white over privileged upper class wannabe fascists who game Twitter’s algorithms to gain “fame” (and therefore money).</p>

<p>What’s the point of this post? I guess I’m hoping that some of you will change your behaviour when using Twitter.</p>

<p>The wannabe fascists use your outrage to spread their message. Every time you quote tweet them, expressing how vile something they’re saying is, you’re amplifying that. And every one of your followers that sees it, likes or retweets your tweet is telling the Twitter algorithm that this content is important. </p>

<p>And because Twitter isn’t chronological, it tells their algorithm to push that content to the top of people’s feeds. Virality achieved, which helps spread their disgusting message giving them a platform to spew their lies and hate, and pay their bills.</p>

<h3>So what’s the solution?</h3>

<p>It’s actually really simple. Block them. Starve them of the platform, and their messages won’t get out. It also has the benefit of cleaning up the shit that appears in your timeline.</p>
