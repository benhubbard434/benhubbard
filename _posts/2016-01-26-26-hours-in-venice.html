title: 26 Hours in Venice

<p>I spent 26 hours in Venice, and took some photos. I'd definitely recommend visiting at this time of year, as the city was practically deserted. I spent a lot of time just wandering round in circles, getting to know my way around the small island, and taking pictures everywhere.</p>
