title: My 2018 Reading List
category: marketing
---

<p>I'm trying to read more often, and consistently. In the last few years, the only time I've managed to read a book is whilst I'm on holiday. I'm a relatively fast reader, and I get stuck into a book if I'm enjoying it (I read "Ready Player One" in 2 days). There's no reason for me not to read throughout the rest of the year. Also, having moved across to the marketing team at GatherContent, I need to read more to get my knowledge up to date.</p>
<p>I'm going to add to this post with all the books I read this year, creating a Product Marketing reading list. I'll also, from time to time, add a post of my key takeaways that I can apply to my role.</p>
