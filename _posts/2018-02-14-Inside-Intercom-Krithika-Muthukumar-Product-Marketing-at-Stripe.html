<h3>My notes &amp; takeaways:</h3>
<p>Krithika's early role involved a lot of content creation - there wasn’t much content on the site and customers didn’t know what features existed in the product. The next task was to establish channels to communicate feature launches, as there wasn’t a process to do this and customers weren't discovering these launches.</p>
<p>Stripe has 4 out of the 12 marketers working as Product Marketers. The other 8 focus on events & field, and growth (paid and funnel) - the other main channels that Stripe works in. To work effectively, they set up a product calendar which includes all the planned launches over the next 6 months. This is used to track all the upcoming launches in an organised fashion, and used to plan how these impact specific teams. This gives the marketing team time to build the necessary messaging and positioning for the new releases. This also allows the product marketing team time to interview and talk with customers to establish and test this messaging.</p>

<p>As a part of this process, early on in the planning a “spec" blog post is created. The core messaging of this blog post is used by the product team to check the feature meets the users needs, and is translated into the content that’s created for the launch.</p>

<p>This works because b2b products don't rely on one big launch event. Multiple product feature announcements can be used to build on a specific theme. An example of this might be security - a number of smaller feature launches can be used to build up a picture of security first features.</p>

<p>At GatherContent, we should consider planning our next upcoming launch using this model. It's a large launch, with multiple audiences that will be affected by the features we launch. This could be a good way of sharing all the nuances of the features we're working on.</p>
