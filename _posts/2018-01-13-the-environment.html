title: Being nicer to the planet.

<p>I've been thinking a lot recently about how I can be nicer to the planet. The discussion on global warming makes me feel quite helpless, with talk of sea levels rising and engulfing parts of the UK, ice caps melting in turn causing polar bears <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2017/dec/09/footage-of-starving-polar-bear-exposes-climate-change-impact-video">to starve</a>, amongst other planet changing events

</p>
<p>Taking a step back, I started to think some more about what I could do. It's easy to think"if it's only me making these changes, it won't change anything", but ultimately everyone's small action contributes to society. I guess that's the reason I'm sharing this as well - giving people some ideas with what they can do to make the planet a better place!
</p>
<h2>Renewable electricity </h2>
<p>The first thing I did was moved my electricity over to <a href="https://bulb.co.uk/refer/ben1645">Bulb</a> (ðŸ‘ˆ use this link to get Â£50 off - I get Â£50 too!). They're 100% renewable energy, and on top of that they're averagely cheaper than the normal suppliers. I've ended up saving around Â£15 a month on my bill and they also emailed recently to share exactly what environmental impact using Bulb has - it saved the 3007kg of carbon dioxide in 2017, the equivalent of a killer whale.

<h2>Environmentally friendly loo roll</h2>
<p>We use a lot of plastic in supermarket goods, especially the fruit & veg isle. Whilst I'm still looking into ways in which I can use less plastic here, I did stumble across a company called <a href="https://uk.whogivesacrap.org/">Who Gives a Crap</a>, who make 100% recycled toilet paper. The rolls are also pretty friendly, no inks, dyes or scents are used to manufacture them.
</p>
<p>Not only that, each roll comes individually wrapped in paper, so you can recycle all the packaging - something which annoys me with other brands. The only drawback? You have to order quite a few rolls, so make sure you have enough space.
</p>
<p>Just to top it all off, Who Gives a Crap donate half of all their profits to non-profits working to improve access to hygiene, water and basic sanitation in developing countries. Up until now, theyâ€™ve donated $1,175,000, which is enough to help tens of thousands of people in need.
</p>
<h2>Use less plastic items</h2>
<p>I didn't really think about what happened to my toothbrush once I'd finished using it. If you follow a dentists recommendation, you'll be using 4 toothbrushes a year. This doesn't sound like a huge number, but when you multiple that by the 65+ million people that live in the UK, that becomes a pretty huge number of toothbrushes.
</p>
<p>I've started looking at bamboo toothbrushes - &Keep, a sustainable shop based in Dorset have a decent range of a brand called HydroPhil. They also do a bunch of other bathroom & kitchen related products, such as beeswax food wrap, an alternative to cling film.
</p>
<p>Over time, I'm going to add to this post with any other interesting environmentally friendly products I discover.
