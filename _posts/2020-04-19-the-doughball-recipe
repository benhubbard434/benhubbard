<p>For those of you who&#39;ve been to mine for a social gathering, you know that <em>the</em> dough balls are famous. I donâ€™t know exactly where the recipe comes from, but itâ€™s hand written in the recipe book. So many people have asked me for the recipe, I thought it was time to get it onto the blog.</p>

<p>If you have a fancy mixer, like a KitchenAid, the prep time is about 10 minutes, plus 2 proving sessions. This recipe is for 2 people - increase the quantity.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<h3 id="for-the-dough-balls">For the dough balls</h3>
<ul>
<li>125g White Bread Flour </li>
<li>2g of Yeast</li>
<li>1/4 tsp Golden Caster Sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
<li>75ml Warm Water</li>
<li>15ml Olive Oil</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-the-garlic-butter">For the garlic butter</h3>

<li>1 Garlic Clove (crushed)</li>
<li>1 tbsp Parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mix the flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Then, mix the water and olive oil together separately. Mix the water/olive oil mix slowly into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Knead hard for 10 minutes by hand, or 6 minutes with the dough hook in a mixer.</li>
<li>Lightly grease your mixing bowl with oil. Put your dough in, and cover it with a clean towel. Leave it to rise for 1 hour, until itâ€™s doubled in size.</li>
<li>Knock back by gently kneading 5 times. Cut into 10 pieces and shape them into balls. Here are your dough balls ðŸ’ª</li>
<li>Place them on your baking tray, and cover them with the towel again. Allow them to rise again, until theyâ€™re doubled in size.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C.</li>
<li>Bake for 5-8 minutes.</li>
<li>Whilst theyâ€™re baking, melt half your butter and lightly fry your crushed garlic. Mash all the ingredients (the melted and non melted butter, fried crushed garlic and parsley) together.</li>
<li>Brush this on your dough balls, and serve. Lightly season with salt if you want.</li>
</ol>
