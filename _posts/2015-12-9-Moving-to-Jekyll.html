title: Moving to Jekyll
category: general

<p>I've moved this blog to Jekyll! I thought I'd use it as an opportunity to learn a new system, and to take a fresh start with my blog.
</p>
<h3>Starting anew</h3>
<p>It's not often you get a chance to start afresh. I've been sporadically writing articles across a period of a few years, and some of these had become out of date. The subjects of the articles have moved on so much, that to update them would turn into a full re-write. So we're here!
</p>
<h3>Learning Jekyll</h3>
<p>Why Jekyll? I've been interested in building websites since I was at University. To keep myself up to date with the latest technologies, I wanted to build the blog on a static site generator. Having the understanding of how different platforms work helps me to understand the use cases of our users at GatherContent.
