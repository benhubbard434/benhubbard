    <h2 class="centre">Identifying a good fit</h2>
    
    <div class="industry-content">
      <p>At GatherContent, we noticed that we had a better product-market fit in certain verticals. Any website which had a lot of information, with a complex information architecture was a good fit for the product. Higher Education fits into this category, and we saw that institutions that were using the platform were having great success across our key account metrics.</p>
      <p>I worked with our Customer Success team to write about these successes. I then built an automation in Drip to tag all subscribers with an .ac.uk or .edu email address, and added bonus content to the weekly newsletter, distributing these case studies. Finally, I pulled together a landing page, which we could link to on social, and via our other channels.</p>
      <h5>Examples</h5>
      <p>üí° <a href="https://gathercontent.com/industries/higher-education">GatherContent Higher Education landing page.</a> This is still contains some of the original assets, and messaging is largely consistent with how it was when it launched.</p>
      <p>üó£Ô∏è <a href="https://gathercontent.com/blog/university-reading-make-content-team-central-content-production-process">University of Reading case study</a>.</p>
      <p>üîé <a href="https://gathercontent.com/blog/university-aberdeen-using-gathercontent-develop-online-prospectus">University of Aberdeen case study</a>.</p>
      <h5>Results</h5>
      <p>Doubled the number of Higher Education customers within 3 months.</p>

    <h2 class="centre">Stopping the rot</h2>
    <p class="centre">We had a 4 month problem. 4 months into their life with us, 10% of customers were cancelling.</p>
    <h5>What did I do?</h5>
    <p>I studied some metrics. Looking at accounts who had been with us for 2+ years, I mapped the most used features out. A combination of three stood out - they were compelling enough to get the organisation to move away from Google Docs, the biggest "old way".</p>
    <p>I then added in triggered emails, based on whether or not an account had used these features, encouraging them to set them up

    <h2 class="centre">Relentlessy customer focused</h2>
    <p class="centre">Without customers, there is no business. I'm passionate about making sure that the customers I serve have the best expierence. Sometimes, this means saying no. Sometimes, it means bending over backward to create a great experience for them.</p>
    <h5 class="centre">How?</h5>
    <p class="centre">Listening. I've learned that by talking to customers, and in turn listening to them, you can work out what they need to know. This information is so, so valuable to the marketing team. An anecdote by <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/positioning">April Dunford</a> really sums this up well - without listening to customers, an unsuccessful product would have been shelved - but instead went on to be sold.</p>
    <p class="centre">By mirroring how customers spoke about their success, they re-framed how potential customers pictured using their products.</p>
